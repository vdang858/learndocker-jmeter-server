#
# Dockerfile to create a jmeter-server image.
# 
# Usage:
#  docker run -d \         
#             -p 0.0.0.0:port-on-host:1099 \
#             -p 0.0.0.0:some-other-port-on-host:60000 \
#             -v /some/local/path:/logs \
#             -v /some/other/local/path:/input-data \
#             ssankara/jmeter-server
#
# TODO - Parameterize jmeter version in the ENTRYPOINT.
#        Don't know how at the moment.  Cannot seem to use $VAR.  It is not converted; probably
#        because it is in a quoted string.
#
# TODO - Currently exposed ports are hard-coded to use values that are in the jmeter.properties.
#        It would be nice to be able to parameterize the port numbers.
